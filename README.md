Scrapy cookiecutter templating project

[code]
###Project: Srapy-cut
####Background
I'm just starting my Endeavors with cookiecutter,  in my case,  I am constantly creating these scrapy projects and the cut and paste is use a lot since my spiders generally don't change from a go-too 4 spiders that cover all my needs and wants (for work related projects/tasks at least) other then maybe a couple tweaks and obviously the response/request selection fields.


####Objectives
>1. From cookiecutter be able to input variable into the spider

>2. From cookicutter be able to insert input of variables in a loop untill a stop.

>3. From cookicutter be able to include pre-deffined setting variables (or exclude)


####Scope
The endresult of this project would be to create a template source of which one could call upon to quickly create scrapy project for any given desired scrape need.

####PHASE1:
 Create cookiecut template of which Items are predfined and simply defining the input value in the JSON config file
